# RF_fingerprints_ML
In this project, an efficient method based on artificial intelligence has been tried to determine for identify the identity change of authorized devices from unauthorized devices that are trying to change their identity to enter the local network and to prevent unauthorized devices from entering this secure network.
The presented method is authentication based on radio frequency fingerprints of wireless devices and their modeling with machine learning algorithms.
In this Experimental Study, 12000 data which have 204 features were collected and used by the Hack RF One radio receiver
, and then three machine learning algorithms, Support vector Machin, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression has been used for data modeling and authentication verification.
Finally, with 1000 test data, the models have been evaluated and compared with each other, and the best model has been selected. 
The results obtained in the best case in the SVM algorithm are about 87 % and authentication in KNN is about 64% and authentication in Logistic is about 65%.
